Repo with wallpapers coming from ArcoLinux and HefftorLinux

## Brave personalization

`brave_switch` contains script and files to replace Brave Browser deault wallpapers. In order to do it:

1. Find in your disk the current wallpaper name (you can see the name in the developer tools in the default brave tab)
2. Go to the folder an check that is the correct one (will contain the files that you see in `brave_switch` with other images)
3. Replace `photo.json` and the images with the `*.webp` images that you want and modify `photo.json` in consequence (you can use `script.py` to do it)
